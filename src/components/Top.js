        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello My name is Scottie Chambers I am from Charlottesville, Virginia
          where I spent most of my life growing up. I am a retired division 2
          basketball and volleyball player from Pfeiffer University where I
          studied exercise science. During my time at school I was able to talk
          one of my professors into an independent study of Engineering. There I
          learned about the ability to build with purpose. We even started
          coding with an arduino where I got even more hooked on Technology and
          the ability to build within current systems. Though I wanted to
          continue on my school did not offer a computer science degree, nor did
          I have the ability to transfer schools at this time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even with that said I did not let that passion die, I researched and
          wanted to learn about a computer from the inside out so I got the
          parts and built one of my own. I learned about the importance of every
          piece of the computer even down to the operating system. From there I
          tried to teach myself to code. I tried youtube, free coding apps on my
          phone and even some free websites, but I had questions but no one to
          ask. After hard thought and consideration I seeked a bootcamp that
          would help lead me in the right direction and help answer the
          questions. Now that I am finished with the bootcamp I still love
          learning and problem solving and overall building applications and
          projects.
